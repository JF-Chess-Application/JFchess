# JFchess

JFChess is a online chess game built by an Agile software development team. Under the guidance of a senior software engineer, we had weekly Agile team meetings for code reviews, sprint planning, and feature assignments.

In addition to Ruby on Rails, this app demonstrates the usage of: 
- HTML/CSS
